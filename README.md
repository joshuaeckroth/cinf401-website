# cinf401-website

Install [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and build the site with:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
```

Now you can navigate to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) and you will have a served version of the site. Any changes you make in an editor will automatically be reflected in the served site.
