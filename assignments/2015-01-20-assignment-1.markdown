# Assignment 1

## Task 1

Find two projects that purport to require "big data analysis." We looked at one example in the [big data notes](/notes/big-data.html). Answer these questions about the projects:

- Who is responsible for this project?
- What are the project's aims? What is its contribution to an organization or to society?
- What kind of data will be (or is being) analyzed?
- Why should the data be considered "big data"?
- What tools will they use (are they using)? Note, this information might not be available, but try to find out.

## Task 2

some small tasks in R, git, bitbucket
