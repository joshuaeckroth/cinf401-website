# Assignment 2

## Task 1

Grab the first table of [Foreign Terrorist Organizations](http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm) (the one called "Designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations") entirely using R. The R book, p. 80 has an example using the `XML` library and `readHTMLTable` function.

Produce a data frame sorted by terrorist name, i.e., the following:

{% highlight r %}
  Date Designated                           Name
49       5/30/2012  Abdallah Azzam Brigades (AAB)
2        10/8/1997   Abu Nidal Organization (ANO)
3        10/8/1997         Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG)
27       3/27/2002 Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade (AAMB)

59       5/15/2014                al-Nusrah Front
