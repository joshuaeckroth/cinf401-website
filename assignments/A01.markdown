# Assignment 1

Create a new repository on Bitbucket, called "cinf401-assignment-1", and add me (joshuaeckroth) as a "reader". Then create a new project in RStudio with the same name and a new R Markdown file with the same name. See the [RStudio workflow](/notes/rstudio-workflow.html) for instructions.

Complete the tasks below. Write your answers, intermixed with R code and plots (if/when appropriate), in the single R Markdown file. Commit and push your changes to Bitbucket so I can retrieve them on my own machine. I will regenerate your final report by "knitting" your R Markdown file. See the [syllabus](/notes/syllabus.html) for the general grading rubric.

## Task 1

Find two projects that purport to require "big data analysis." We looked at three case studies in the [big data notes](/notes/big-data.html). Answer these questions about the projects:

- Who is responsible for this project?
- What are the project's aims? What is its contribution to an organization or to society?
- What kind of data will be (or is being) analyzed?
- How much data is there? Estimate this if you are unable to find out precisely.
- Why should the data be considered "big data"? Or should it not?
- What tools will they use (are they using)? This information might not be available, but try to find out.

## Task 2

### Part A

Create a vector of numeric values. Include at least seven values, two of which must be `NA`. Then show how to "normalize" the vector so that the magnitude of the vector (ignoring `NA`'s) is 1.0. Refer to MathWorld for definitions of [normalized vector](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NormalizedVector.html) and [L2-norm](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/L2-Norm.html).

### Part B

Create a data frame with columns "A", "B", "C", and "D", satisfying the following properties:

- Column A contains logical (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) values.
- Column B contains numeric values.
- Column C contains character values.
- Column D contains dates.

Insert five rows of data. Print/show the data frame.

Next, set the column names of the data frame to "W", "X", "Y", and "Z". Print the data frame again.

Update column X (previously called B) so that all of its numeric values are multiplied by 2. Then print just column X, just rows 2-5 (inclusive).

## Task 3

Go to the [IPEDS site](http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/Default.aspx) and follow the directions on the [data sources cookbook](/cookbook/data-sources.html), in the IPEDS section, to grab CSV datasets with the following qualities:

- Final release data
- US Institutions (should be about 7500 of them)
- Variables: Graduation rate with Bachelor degree within 4 years, total (all students), all years

You'll get a CSV file with several columns (institution fields, plus a column for each year). Cast/melt/merge/munge until you have a data frame that looks like this, with the exact column names shown (the rows may appear in a different order, that's no problem):

```
   UnitID                      InstitutionName Year Rate
10 222178         Abilene Christian University 2016   45
12 138558 Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College 2016    3
14 172866                      Academy College 2016    0
23 108232            Academy of Art University 2016    5
61 126182               Adams State University 2016    8
62 188429                   Adelphi University 2016   54
...
```

Running `summary` on the data frame will summarize each column (mean, max, min, etc.). Do this so we can be sure you've combined all the data (see how all the years are represented):

```
     UnitID                      InstitutionName       Year           Rate       
 Min.   :100654   Stevens-Henager College:   39   2015   :2068   Min.   :  0.00  
 1st Qu.:153834   Union College          :   27   2014   :2030   1st Qu.: 15.00  
 Median :190716   Westminster College    :   27   2016   :2027   Median : 30.00  
 Mean   :202669   Lincoln University     :   26   2013   :1997   Mean   : 33.58  
 3rd Qu.:218410   Anderson University    :   18   2012   :1935   3rd Qu.: 50.00  
 Max.   :489937   Aquinas College        :   18   2011   :1894   Max.   :196.00  
                  (Other)                :17279   (Other):5483                   
```

Show Stetson's individual year rates:

```
      UnitID    InstitutionName Year Rate
5939  137546 Stetson University 2016   56
13296 137546 Stetson University 2015   56
20653 137546 Stetson University 2014   56
28010 137546 Stetson University 2013   56
35367 137546 Stetson University 2012   51
42724 137546 Stetson University 2011   50
50081 137546 Stetson University 2010   55
57438 137546 Stetson University 2009   55
64795 137546 Stetson University 2008   53
```

Now, make a data frame with the average 4-year graduation rate, across all years, for each school:

```
  UnitID                      InstituionName   AvgRate
1 100654            Alabama A & M University 11.000000
2 100663 University of Alabama at Birmingham 21.111111
3 100690                  Amridge University  6.875000
4 100706 University of Alabama in Huntsville 15.222222
5 100724            Alabama State University  8.333333
6 100751           The University of Alabama 38.666667
...
```

Finally, show Steston's average rate. It should be 54.22 :(
