# Project 3

Using Google's [NYC Taxi data in BigQuery](https://bigquery.cloud.google.com/table/nyc-tlc:yellow.trips), produce the following plots. Match the styling of each plot (axes, legends, titles, etc.). Check out Google's [sample queries](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/nyc-tlc-trips), but note that page links to the taxi data split by year rather than the combined data.

## Plot 1

![Taxi frequency](/images/taxi-frequency-small.png)

## Plot 2

Outliers were omitted.

![Yearly passenger trends by month](/images/taxi-passsum_monthyear-small.png)

## Plot 3

Outliers were omitted and the horizontal scale was truncated.

## Plot 4

## Plots 5 & 6

Show begin/end of each trip in the morning/evening commute hours across days Mon-Fri. Limit the latitude/longitude values to just 3 digits after the decimal point, and compute the number of trips from the same pickup/dropoff lat/lon. Show a circle at the end of the trip (dropoff lat/lon) and sized according to the number of trips with that same pickup/dropoff. Drop records with counts less than 50. Use an alpha=0.05 for the lines and alpha=0.5 for the circles. Limit the plot to the "Midtown Manhattan" map at zoom level 14. See the [ggplot cookbook](/cookbook/ggplot.html#tocAnchor-1-17) for help plotting on maps.
