# Assignment 4

**Create two plots about pokemon. Data available [here](https://github.com/veekun/pokedex/tree/master/pokedex/data/csv).**

Write all of your code in an RMarkdown or R script file. Submit on bitbucket as "cinf401-assignment-4".

**All plots must use a color scheme derived from [this infographic](https://pre09.deviantart.net/0330/th/pre/f/2013/096/b/5/ev_training_quickguide_infographic_by_man9winds-d60nwxi.jpg).**

Plot 1: bar chart; x-axis: pokemon type (name, not id), y-axis: % of pokemon with that type (or count with that type); show % or count above each bar

Plot 2: scatter plot with optional smoothed lines; x-axis: power of move, y-axis: accuracy of move; color of points/lines: damage class (name, not id); include legend explaining the colors

Plot 3: line plot; x-axis: experience level, y-axis: experience required to reach that level; color of lines: experience growth rate type (not id); optional bonus karma: show latex formula for growth rate; include legend explaining the colors

Plot 4: histograms; x-axis: location encounter rate, y-axis: frequency; use facet wrap to separate histograms by encounter method (name, not id)

Plot 5: stacked bar chart; x-axis: item category (name, not id), y-axis: % of items in that category (stacked bars should always add up to 100%); bar fill color: item flags (name, not id)

Plot 6: bipartite graph (like [this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BimvqvqCUAA4uhR.png)); left and right side have same list of pokemon in same order; lines indicate pokemon X and breed with pokemon Y; refer to breeding compatibility on [this chart](https://img.pokemondb.net/images/egg-groups.png) (from [here](https://pokemondb.net/mechanics/breeding)); optional bonus karma: show pokemon images as well as or instead of names
