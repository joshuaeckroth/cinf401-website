### Class demonstrations

You will be required to demonstrate (for 5-15 minutes) a data mining/analysis/programming technique in front of the class, on three separate occasions. The techniques demonstrated will be added (by me) to the "cookbooks" on this website.

The purpose of these demonstrations is to ensure you are engaged with the material but also to show others a wide variety of techniques for handling data. We will use a wide range of tools in this class, and will not have time to learn most of them in depth. Thus, it will be useful for everyone to learn from each other the various tricks each of us discovers as we munge, analyze, and visualize our datasets.

Demonstrations will happen most weeks, involving maybe 2-5 students each week. We'll establish a schedule early in the semester.

### Assignments

Assignments are individual activities, done outside of class or during lab. You will turn in your materials via [git](/cookbook/git.html) and [Bitbucket](bitbucket.org). See [Assignment 1](/assignments/assignment-1.html) for details.

### Group projects

Groups consist of 2-3 people. These projects are more complex than assignments. Good group communication is essential to complete the tasks. Be sure everyone has a subtask and each person knows the state of progress of everyone else.

You will turn in your materials via [git](/cookbook/git.html) and [Bitbucket](bitbucket.org). See [Assignment 1](/assignments/assignment-1.html) for details.

## Honor code

You are allowed to a small amount of code from websites (assuming the code is open source) and our books. You must indicate where you got the code (put a comment in the code). More than 50% of your work must be original.

I am strongly in agreement with the [Stetson University Honor Code](http://www.stetson.edu/other/honor-system/). Any form of cheating is not acceptable, will not be tolerated, and could lead to dismissal from the University. This includes plagiarism of any sort on quizzes, exams, or on projects. So please, do not cheat!

## Academic success center

If a student anticipates barriers related to the format or requirements of a course, she or he should meet with the course instructor to discuss ways to ensure full participation. If disability-related accommodations are necessary, please register with the Academic Success Center (822-7127; [www.stetson.edu/asc](http://www.stetson.edu/asc)) and notify the course instructor of your eligibility for reasonable accommodations. The student, course instructor, and the Academic Success Center will plan how best to coordinate accommodations. The Academic Success Center is located at 209 E Bert Fish Drive, and can be contacted using the email address [asc@stetson.edu](mailto:asc@stetson.edu).
