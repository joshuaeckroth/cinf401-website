## Markdown

#### You can hyperlink words, making URL’s condensed looking much nicer.

[Dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog "Wikipedia: Dog")

[Cat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat "Wikipedia: Cat")


#### You can also throw your own HTML in to markdown and it will read it and write it for you.
<br></br>
<button class="button-save large">A Button</button>



#### Want to make footnotes cause you’re feeling fancy?

Fox[^1] jumped over the lazy dog[^2]

Then if you just kept typing, these footnotes are always positioned, obviously..
at the bottom of the page. With quicklinks built in between for quick usage.



[^1]: Foxes are red
[^2]: Dogs are usually not red
```
